# Flash Card App

## Description
An app that lets users create collections of flashcards and review the cards in each collection to improve their understanding of a topic.  

## Motive
I knew my girlfriend used flashcard apps to help her study different topics, so I thought it could be enjoyable and possibly beneficial to try my hand at making a flashcard app. 

## What I Learned 
I learned how to handle different routes with React-Router and learned how to leverage a component library with React-Bootstrap.
